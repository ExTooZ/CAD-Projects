# CAD-Projects
CAD Projects during the module Konstruktionslehre 1 and Darstellung Technischer Systeme. Both modules uses Soliddedge as the CAD software.

## DTS Project
In this project we are assigned to make an assembly of a Lagereinheit(bearing unit). The instructions on how to make the parts are given with its dimensions to guide us in making the assembly. Some of the parts are created on our own and some are downloaded with accordance to the DIN Norms. All of the parts are contained within the parts folder. The assembly folder has the final assembly of the bearing unit and it can also be viewed through the PDF file in the PDF folder. The draft folder contains the engineering drawing of the assembly.

## KL Project
In this project we are assigned to make an assembly of a Rotorwelleneinheit (Rotorshaft unit). In this project we are more independent on how we create the rotorshaft unit. We are required to meet some of the criterias such as the Norms according to DIN, materials used for some of the parts, tolerances, and obviously the dimensions. The parts that are downloaded are in the downloaded parts folder and the parts that are self made are in the parts folder.
